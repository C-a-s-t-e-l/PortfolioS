My journey beganat Colegio de San Jose, where I studied for 12 years,immersing myself in both academics and extracurricularactivities. My love for art, particularly painting andsketching, has always been a vital part of my identity,serving as a medium for self-expression and exploration. In addition to art, I discovered a passion for sports,especially swimming, which taught me perseverance,discipline, and hard work. I also took on leadershiproles in various school organizations, which honed myconfidence, organizational skills, and ability to workcollaboratively. These experiences fostered a deep desireto make a positive impact within my community and to growalongside others.
                        Now, as I pursue my degree in Information Technology, Istrive to merge my creative talents with my technicalskills, aiming to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving digital world.
